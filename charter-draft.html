					Scope
				</h2>
				<p>
					In order to improve the support of privacy in Web standards, the Privacy Interest Group (PING) will broadly investigate ongoing Web privacy issues and methods of systematically addressing privacy concerns during the standardization process.</p>
					
					<p>The group will consider and discuss any privacy issues that affect users of the Web. This may include, but is not limited to, issues related to: online tracking; location, health and financial data; eGovernment initiatives; and online social networking and identity. Where appropriate, the Interest Group will recommend areas where W3C should begin recommendation-track standards work on privacy issues and may prototype or initiate such work within the group.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, the Interest Group will develop and document guidelines, patterns, processes and best practices for addressing privacy considerations in Web standards. The Interest Group may provide a locus of expertise to help consider (proactively or reactively) privacy issues that arise in other W3C standards work.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Success Criteria
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Increased awareness of Web privacy implications within W3C.</li>
					<li>Establishment of a systematic process for privacy considerations in Web standards.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="deliverables">
					Deliverables
				</h2>
				<p>
					The group may publish documents like the following that are consistent with the above scope. The titles of the documents are indicative only.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Privacy Considerations for Web Standards</strong>, Group Note.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>
					Other Deliverables
				</h3>
				<p>
					The Interest Group may also publish analyses of potential privacy issues (to provide greater awareness or architectural suggestions), prototype specifications for new privacy areas, guidelines for user interface design or other similar documents.

					Participation
				</h2>
				<p>
					Participation in the Privacy Interest Group is open to the public. Participants who do not represent a W3C Member should join as <a href="/2004/08/invexp.html" shape="rect">Invited Experts</a>. Invited Experts in this group are not granted access to Member-only information.
				</p>				
				<p>Anyone (participating in the group or not) may subscribe to the group's public mailing list and engage in discussion. Those who intend to contribute to deliverables will be asked to join the group.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Chairs may call occasional meetings consistent with the <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#GeneralMeetings" shape="rect">W3C Process requirements for meetings</a>.

					This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list <strong><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/">public-privacy</a></strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/">Privacy Activity home page</a>.

					Decision Policy
				</h2>
				<p>
					As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When the Chairs put a question and observe dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chairs should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.

					Patent Disclosures
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Privacy Interest Group provides an opportunity to share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure" shape="rect">Section 6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.
				</p>
				<p>
					For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="/2004/01/pp-impl/" shape="rect">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.
