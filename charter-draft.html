				The <strong>mission</strong> of W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/">Privacy Interest Group</a>
				(PING) is to improve privacy on the Web by advising groups
				developing standards on how to avoid and mitigate privacy issues with their
				technologies and by incubating new work that reduces fingerprinting surface area
				and other privacy risks.

				<h2 id="scope">
					Scope
				</h2>
				<p>	The Privacy Interest Group (PING) develops and documents guidelines,
					patterns, processes and best practices for addressing privacy
					considerations in Web standards.
				</p>
				<p>	PING provides "horizontal review" - offering groups developing web standards
					on-request guidance on privacy issues and mitigations specific to their
					technologies.  PING aims to offer this review as early in the technology
					development lifecycle as requested, observing that early feedback is often
					more helpful.  PING may also seek out technologies that might benefit from
					earlier privacy review and conduct such reviews on its own initiative.
				</p>
				<p>	From time to time, PING incubates standards work on privacy issues by
					collecting requirements, prototyping, and/or initiating the work within
					the IG and recommending that the W3C move the work into other groups when
					appropriate.
				</p>	
				<p>	When privacy issues are found in existing features of the Web platform,
					PING may recommend mitigations for those issues,
					up to and including deprecation of the features.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Success Criteria
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>	Feedback to other W3C groups, upon request, regarding privacy issues
						in their specifications.</li>
					<li>	Systematizing the privacy review of Web standards.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="deliverables">
					Deliverables
				</h2>
				<p>	In conjunction with W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/tag">Technical Architecture Group (TAG)</a>
					PING maintains a <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/">Self-Review
					Questionnaire for Security and Privacy</a>.
				</p>
				<p>	PING maintains a document providing further detail on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/">
					Mitigating Browser Fingerprinting in Web Specifications</a>.
				</p>	
				<p>	PING may publish other documents consistent with the above scope such as
					analyses of privacy issues, prototype specifications, and guidelines for user
					interface design.

					Participation
				</h2>
				<p>
					Participation in PING is open to the public. Participants who do not represent a W3C Member
					should join as <a href="/2004/08/invexp.html" shape="rect">Invited Experts</a>. Invited Experts
					in this group are not granted access to Member-only information.
				</p>				
				<p>	Anyone may subscribe to the group's public mailing list and engage in discussion. Those who
					intend to contribute to deliverables will be asked to join the group.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="communication">
				<h2 id="communication">
					Communication
				</h2>
				<p>
					This group conducts its work on the public mailing list <strong><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/">public-privacy</a></strong>
					and in periodic teleconferences, typically 1-2 times per month.  Additionally, the group meets
					face to face at TPAC.  PING is experimenting with using a free Slack workspace - interesting
					discussions from Slack will be called out to the mailing list, and decisions will not be
					finalized based solely on Slack discussions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings,
					teleconferences, etc.) is available from
					the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/">Privacy Activity home page</a>.

				<h2 id="decisions">
					Decision Policy
				</h2>
				<p>
					As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions by consensus. When the Chairs put a question and observe dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chairs should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="patent">
				<h2 id="patentpolicy">
					Patent Disclosures
				</h2>
				<p>
					Interest Group participants have an obligation to comply with patent disclosure
					obligations as set out in <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure" shape="rect">Section 6</a> of the
					W3C Patent Policy.  These obligations apply both to Recommendation-track work incubated in the 
					Interest Group as well as to feedback offered to Working Groups when reviewing
					their Recommendation-track specifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="/2004/01/pp-impl/" shape="rect">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.
