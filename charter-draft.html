			<p class="mission">
				The <strong>mission</strong> of W3C's <abbr title="Privacy Interest Group"><a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/">PING</a></abbr>
				(PING) is to improve privacy on the Web by advising groups
				developing standards on how to avoid and mitigate privacy issues with their
				technologies and by incubating new work that reduces privacy risks and
				fingerprinting surface area.  PING also suggests changes to existing standards
				and technologies to improve the privacy of existing systems.  Finally,
				PING makes recommendations to the W3C Advisory Committee and the
				W3C TAG about whether a proposed standard would be beneficial or
				harmful for privacy on the web.

				<h2 id="scope">
					Scope
				</h2>
				<p>	The Privacy Interest Group (PING) develops and documents guidelines,
					patterns, processes and best practices for addressing privacy
					considerations in Web standards.
				</p>
				<p>	PING provides "<a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal
					review</a>" - offering groups developing web standards
					on-request guidance on privacy issues and mitigations specific to their
					technologies.  PING aims to offer this review as early in the technology
					development lifecycle as requested, observing that early feedback is often
					more helpful.  PING may also seek out technologies that might benefit from
					earlier privacy review and conduct such reviews on its own initiative.
				</p>
				<p>	PING incubates standards work on privacy issues by
					collecting requirements, prototyping, and/or initiating the work within
					the IG and recommending that the W3C move the work into other groups when
					appropriate.  For example, PING may incubate work to reconcile differences
					in browser vendors' approaches to privacy-protecting features, potentially
					to include guidelines, best practices, and standards work.
				</p>
				<p>
					PING may recommend mitigations for privacy issues found in existing
					features of the Web platform,
					up to and including deprecation of the features.
				</p>
				<p>
					PING may provide input to the W3C Process Community Group on process changes
					that will improve privacy in Web standards, e.g. by establishing particular
					requirements on the identification and mitigation of privacy issues
					in W3C Recommendations.
				</p>
				<p>
					PING may make recommendations to the W3C Advisory Committee and the
					W3C <abbr title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</abbr> regarding
					the privacy impact of proposed standards.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Success Criteria
				</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>	Feedback to other W3C groups, upon request, regarding privacy issues
						in their specifications.</li>
					<li>	Systematizing the privacy review of Web standards.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="deliverables">
					Deliverables
				</h2>
				<p>	In conjunction with W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/tag">Technical Architecture Group (TAG)</a>
					PING maintains a <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/">Self-Review
					Questionnaire for Security and Privacy</a>.
				</p>
				<p>	PING maintains a document providing further detail on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/">
					Mitigating Browser Fingerprinting in Web Specifications</a>.
				</p>	
				<p>	PING may publish other documents consistent with the above scope such as
					analyses of privacy issues, prototype specifications, and guidelines for user
					interface design and future standards.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="dependencies">
				<h2 id="coordination">
					Dependencies and Liaisons
				</h2>
				<h3>
					W3C Groups
				</h3>
				<p>
					It is expected that most Working and Interest Groups will ask 
					PING to review their specifications.
				</p>
				<p>	PING will seek horizontal review of its own deliverables for accessibility,
					internationalization, performance, and security with the relevant
					Working and Interest Groups and with the TAG.
				</p>
				<p>
					PING should collaborate with the WICG and TAG to coordinate privacy review
					of specifications early in their development lifecycle. 
				</p>
				<p>	PING may collaborate with the W3C Web Advertising Business Group and
					the WICG on privacy issues related to advertising.
				</p>

			</div>
			<div class="participation">
				<h2 id="participation">
					Participation
				</h2>
				<p>
					Participation in PING is open to the public. Participants who do not represent a W3C Member
					should join as <a href="/2004/08/invexp.html" shape="rect">Invited Experts</a>. Invited Experts
					in this group are not granted access to Member-only information.
				</p>				
				<p>	Anyone may subscribe to the group's public mailing list and engage in discussion. Those who
					intend to contribute to deliverables will be asked to join the group.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="communication">
				<h2 id="communication">
					Communication
				</h2>
				<p>
					This group conducts its work on the public mailing list <strong><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/">public-privacy</a></strong>
					and in periodic teleconferences, typically 1-2 times per month.  Additionally, the group meets
					face to face at <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/TPOverview.html"><abbr title=“Technical Plenary and Advisory Committee”>TPAC</abbr></a>.  PING is experimenting with using a free Slack workspace - interesting
					discussions from Slack will be called out to the mailing list, and decisions will not be
					finalized based solely on Slack discussions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings,
					teleconferences, etc.) is available from
					the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/IG/">PING home page</a>.

				<h2 id="decisions">
					Decision Policy
				</h2>
				<p>
					As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section 3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions by consensus. When the Chairs put a question and observe dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chairs should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="patent">
				<h2 id="patentpolicy">
					Patent Disclosures
				</h2>
				<p>
					Interest Group participants have an obligation to comply with patent disclosure
					obligations as set out in <a href="/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure" shape="rect">Section 6</a> of the
					W3C Patent Policy.  These obligations apply both to Recommendation-track work incubated in the 
					Interest Group as well as to feedback offered to Working Groups when reviewing
					their Recommendation-track specifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="/2004/01/pp-impl/" shape="rect">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.
