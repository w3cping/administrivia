    <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/privacy">Privacy
        Working Group</a> is to
      improve privacy on the Web both by advising groups developing standards on
      how to avoid and mitigate privacy issues with Web technologies
      <em>and</em> by standardizing mechanisms that improve user privacy on the Web.

      <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is a human right that must be protected and it is essential to the success of the Web platform. So many of the features of the Web and its usage involve information about people and their communications that privacy must be considered consistently across the design of the platform. To affirmatively realize the privacy of people using the Web and address privacy threats that have already arisen, some dedicated privacy features must also be developed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Horizontal review for privacy was previously conducted by the Privacy Interest Group (PING), which also served as a general discussion point for potential new privacy work and had been chartered to include incubation of new work but typically didn't do so. Because incubation is now more directly handled elsewhere, there is a need for a Working Group to adopt and standardize some new privacy mechanisms for the Web and a significant overlap with the privacy expertise needed for horizontal reviews. This proposed Working Group would replace the Interest Group.
      </p>        
    </div>

    <section id="scope" class="scope">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        The Privacy Working Group will standardize technical mechanisms that improve privacy on the Web. Privacy is a
        broad and contested concept, but the Working Group will focus on mechanisms for adoption by user agents, web
        sites and other actors in order to realize <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">privacy
          principles for the
          Web</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Privacy Working Group will conduct reviews and provide guidance to other groups about ways to improve user
        privacy through the development of Web standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Privacy Working Group will work on only the normative specifications listed in the deliverables section
        below. Future revisions to the charter may update the proposed deliverables when there is opportunity for
        sufficient impact for improving privacy and when the Working Group has sufficient capacity.
      </p>

      <section id="section-out-of-scope">
        <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
        <p>
          Incubation is preferred through the Community Group process. The Privacy CG incubates privacy-focused web
          features for implementation in browsers and similar user agents. Other privacy-focused features may be
          incubated in WICG or other Community Groups. Features are typically ready to leave incubation for
          standardization when: there is a basic technical design; there is significant implementer interest and
          activity; there is willingness from the proponents to cede control to consensus decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy-focused features specific to online advertising should instead be developed at the Private Advertising
          Technology Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Policy statements and guidance are out of scope for this Working Group. Community Groups may take on
          policy-focused outputs and W3C participants may be interested in collaborating on input to policymakers
          outside of the Working Group.

        <h3>
          Normative Specifications
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt id="gpc" class="spec"><a href="https://privacycg.github.io/gpc-spec/">Global Privacy Control (GPC)</a></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This specification defines a signal, transmitted over HTTP and through the DOM, that conveys a person's request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with third parties. This standard is intended to work with existing and upcoming legal frameworks that render such requests enforceable.</p>

            <p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b> <a
                  href="#">Adopted from Privacy CG</a> (anticipated)</p>
            <p class="milestone"><b>Expected completion:</b>
              <i class="todo">[Q1–4 yyyy]</i></p>
          </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
            The Working Group may choose to develop the following normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
          <dt id="btm" class="spec">
            <a href="https://github.com/privacycg/nav-tracking-mitigations/blob/main/bounce-tracking-explainer.md">Bounce Tracking Mitigation</a></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Browsers are working to prevent cross-site tracking, which threatens user privacy. Navigational tracking, including bounce tracking, correlates user identities across sites during navigations between sites. This specification defines mechanisms to mitigate the privacy impact of bounce trackers.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            Privacy Labels and Declarations
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Labels and declarations about privacy-relevant practices have been proposed as transparency and accountability mechanisms that could improve user privacy by enabling more informed or automated decisions about information requests and by creating legally enforceable commitments for privacy protections.
            </p>
            <p>
              This work would be incubated prior to adoption by the Working Group.

        This Working Group develops both Recommendation-track normative specifications and non-Recommendation-track guidance, include Notes and privacy reviews.
      </p>
      <!-- Testing and interop -->
      <p>In order to advance
        to
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed
          Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
          interoperable
          implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
        interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
        more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
        Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
        test suite of every feature defined in the specification.
      </p>
      <p><span class='todo'>Consider adopting a healthy testing policy, such as:</span>
        To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
        in Candidate Recommendation
        or to features that have deployed implementations
        should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform
        Tests</a> project.
      </p>

      <!-- Horizontal review -->
      <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing 
        all known security and privacy implications for implementers, 
        Web authors, and end users, 
        as well as recommendations for mitigations.
        There should be a clear description of the residual risk 
        to the user or operator of that protocol 
        after threat mitigation has been deployed.</p>

      <p>
        Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including
        ways specification features can be used to address them, and
        recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
      
      <p>
        Guidance documents and reviews should be useful to the Privacy Working Group and to other groups in identifying and addressing privacy in specifications. Generalized principles derived from reviews should be incorporated into the Privacy Principles, Questionnaire and other guidance documents. Guidance should be interpreted consistently. Reviewed specifications should show better support for user privacy on the Web.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to be most helpful and have the greatest success in encouraging privacy-supportive designs, privacy reviews should be conducted regularly and promptly.
      </p>

      <!-- Design principles -->
      <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
        TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">Privacy Principles</a>.

      <h2>Coordination</h2>
      <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
        accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
        Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/"
          title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
        Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
        Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups
        throughout development of
        each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before
        first entering
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
        encouraged
        to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a
        review.

      <p>
        To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for
        its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and
        Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute
        half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement
        for other Participants.
      </p>

        This group primarily conducts its technical work on GitHub repositories, but will also use the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-privacy@w3.org">public-privacy@w3.org</a> (<a
        href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/">archive</a>) and archived asynchronous chat. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
        Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a
        discussion.

      <h2>
        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>.
        Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
        members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
      <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
        consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along
        with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
        decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

        A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based
        survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'><i class="todo">[pick a duration within:] one week to 10
            working days</i></span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

        If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
        consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available
        or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
      </p>
      <p>
        This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
          Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the
        Process Document requires.
